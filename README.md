This git is extracted from my IGARSS lecture on SAR Interferometry (InSAR). 

I made available a serie of Interferometry tutorial on youtube.
This practical session will explain how to apply it to real-world Sentinel-1 images, 
with user-oriented open-source SNAP and StaMPS software.
The main goal is able to produce time series of ground motion from a stack of SAR images. 
Both Window and Unix Operation Systems are supported.
